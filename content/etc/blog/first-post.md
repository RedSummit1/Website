Howdy readers.

This is my first time adding to this so called blog, I have no strict direction for it as yet.

To be honest, the only reason why I am doing this whole blog is because I need something keep me motivated to pursue tech.

I have seen personally that this industry is fueled by greed and explotation.

For me its the sunken cost fallacy, but to others; college is a scam, their are so many other industries to get into where you make more and have better living conditions. 

End of Rant, lets continue.
